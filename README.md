The data used for this assignment can be downloaded from the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The original data files are also stored in this repository in the folder "UCI HAR Dataset".

The 'run_analysis.R' script, which does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets from the original files to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Write the tidy summary in a txt file in the working directory. 

The "HumanActivity_Tidy_Summary" is the product of the 'run_analysis.R' over the original data set. 

The "CodeBook file contains general information about the original data set and a full description of the tidy data set "HumanActivity_Tidy_Summary".
